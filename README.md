# liveview_todos

This is a Work in Progress to show techniques of unit testing elixir Liveview Applications.
We take a simple Todo application and way, way over engineering it. 
This is a complete opposite of YAGNI (You ain't Gonna Need it)
Because we want to show the layers of a typical DDD (Domain Driven Design) application using the structural patterns.
And also show how to test those layers with a stupid simple requirement.

Do not build simple applications with all these layers. 
But if you do have a complex application, do consider if these patterns are useful.
and in any case, make sure to unit-test each layer independently. 

So, this example app may be helpful in how to do that testing.
